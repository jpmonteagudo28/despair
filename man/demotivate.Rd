When cat is 'any' (default), the function combines all category data frames and then
samples from the new,combined data frame.

There are a total of six categories: family, life, work, science, tv, and rednecks.
When a specific category is chosen the function will sample from a demotivational quote data
frame and output a random quote for your spiritual and mental decay.
